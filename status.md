# Janus — status & backlog

_Single tracker for the project (2026-07-20). Replaces the former `gaps.md`
(gap analysis) and `fe-improvements.md` (old React UI punch-list, retired by
the Nocturne → Atrium rewrites) — both removed. This file lists what's
**open**; for what's already built, see the summary below, `docs/roadmap.md`,
`docs/architecture.md`, and git/PR history for detail._

## Where it stands

One Go binary + one Postgres. Backend: envelope encryption (master key →
project KEKs → per-version DEKs), Shamir/KMS unseal, Postgres store with
two-level versioning + soft-delete, password + service-token + OIDC auth,
deny-by-default RBAC, a hash-chained audit log, a full `/v1/` REST API, and
the `janus` CLI (`run`, `secrets`, project/env/config/token control plane).
Feature engines: transit (encryption-as-a-service), scheduled static
rotation, one-way sync (GitHub Actions + Kubernetes), and dynamic Postgres
credentials with a lease manager. On top of the core model: config
inheritance + secret references, project-KEK and master-key rotation,
trash/restore, per-key value history, typed secrets, an env→env promotion
pipeline with four-eyes approval, cursor pagination + `Idempotency-Key`, and
release hygiene (Apache-2.0 license, hand-authored OpenAPI spec, goreleaser,
CHANGELOG, `GET /v1/sys/version`).

UI: a Svelte 5 SPA ("Atrium" — banknote-engraving / archival-ledger
aesthetic, `daylight`/`nightwatch` themes) embedded via `go:embed`, covering
the entire API surface — init/unseal/login, projects → envs → configs, the
secret editor (masked/audited reveal, dirty-buffer saves, per-key history,
locked keys, import/export), the promotion pipeline + approvals, the audit
ledger, tokens, scoped members + an RBAC matrix view, transit, an operations
console (rotation/sync/dynamic, incl. create flows and credential issuance),
an integrations hub (OIDC + CI federation), trash, and a settings hub
(master-key rotate/rekey, backup, seal control). It replaced an earlier
React SPA (through two redesigns, "Nocturne" then "Atrium" — see
[`ui-redo.md`](ui-redo.md) for that history).

All three CLAUDE.md build phases (Core, Transit + UI, Rotation + dynamic) are
complete. Upstream non-goals stay non-goals: no HA/Raft, no PKI/CA, no SSH
signing, no HSM, no multi-tenancy, no FIPS claims.

## In progress

_Nothing in flight._

## Open — backend / ops

- [x] ~~**Account lockout / progressive backoff** beyond the per-IP login rate
      limiter (10/min).~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-22** — progressive temporary
      per-account lockout (5 failures → escalating `1m→5m→25m→1h` window,
      auto-expiring, reset on success; while locked, attempts don't extend the
      window → no DoS). Reveals the lock only to a correct password (`429
      account_locked` + `Retry-After`); wrong password stays byte-identical
      `invalid_credentials` (no enumeration). Admin unlock (`POST
      /v1/users/{id}/unlock`, `user:manage`) + Members "Locked" badge/Unlock;
      `JANUS_LOCKOUT_*` env; migration 000026. Adversarial review SHIP.
- [x] ~~**DB pool tuning** — `pgx` runs on defaults; shutdown grace fixed at
      10s.~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** (ops-hardening bundle) — `JANUS_DB_MAX_CONNS`
      / `JANUS_DB_MIN_CONNS` / `JANUS_DB_MAX_CONN_LIFETIME` /
      `JANUS_DB_MAX_CONN_IDLE_TIME` (via `pgxpool.ParseConfig`+`NewWithConfig`,
      unset = pgx defaults) + configurable `JANUS_SHUTDOWN_GRACE` (default 10s,
      used for the main + aux-listener drains). No migration.
- [x] ~~**Prometheus `/metrics`** (request rates/latency, seal state, lease
      counts, rotation/sync failure gauges, audit head seq) + a
      `JANUS_LOG_LEVEL`/format env var.~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-22** — hand-rolled
      zero-dep exposition, token-gated (`JANUS_METRICS_TOKEN`, off by default),
      HTTP metrics keyed by chi route pattern (bounded cardinality) + engine/DB/
      audit/runtime gauges. Plus an admin **health panel** (Settings, backed by
      `GET /v1/sys/status`) and `JANUS_LOG_LEVEL`/`JANUS_LOG_FORMAT`. Adversarial
      review SHIP. See [observability guide](docs/guides/observability.md).
- [x] ~~**Token `last_used` / user `last_login` not tracked**~~ **SHIPPED
      2026-07-23** — migration 000030 adds `service_tokens.last_used_at` +
      `users.last_login_at`. Token last-used updated on service-token auth,
      **throttled** (≤ once/60s, conditional UPDATE) and **non-fatal** (a failed
      update never fails the request); user last-login stamped in `createSession`
      (covers both password + OIDC login). `GET /v1/tokens` → `last_used_at`,
      `GET /v1/users` → `last_login_at`; Tokens screen "Last used" column +
      stale-token badge (never / 90d+), Members "Last login" column. Value-free.
- [x] ~~**docker-compose has no resource limits**, and no WAL-archiving/
      pg-backup guidance.~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** (ops-hardening bundle) —
      `deploy.resources` limits+reservations on app + postgres; new
      [backup-and-restore guide](docs/guides/backup-and-restore.md)
      (`pg_dump`/`pg_restore` + WAL/PITR, distinguished from the sealed-material
      `janus backup`).
- [x] ~~**No `CONTRIBUTING.md`.**~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** (ops-hardening
      bundle) — build/test/gate/migration/crypto/PR conventions.
- [x] ~~**Decision — OIDC login is not gated by app-level TOTP.**~~ **RESOLVED
      2026-07-23 — intended; documented.** OIDC delegates MFA to the IdP (the
      standard relying-party posture); Janus TOTP gates only the password path.
      Documented in [two-factor-auth guide](docs/guides/two-factor-auth.md#scope-password-logins-only-not-oidc)
      with the both-paths caveat and mitigations. An opt-in "require app 2FA even
      for OIDC" switch is a possible future add, not enforced today.
- [x] ~~**Decision needed — audit fail-closed policy for engine-authored action
      endpoints**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-23 — option (a): accept + document.** The
      engines' action endpoints (rotation/sync/dynamic) keep the fail-closed
      *denial* path; the *success* audit is the engine's best-effort write,
      because the external side effect can't be undone by a late audit failure
      and the `*_runs` tables are a second durable record. Applies uniformly
      across all three engines. Documented in the [operations audit-log
      section](docs/operations.md#audit-log) and `docs/architecture.md`.

## Open — product roadmap

**This section is the canonical tracker and mirrors the five sections of
[`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) one-to-one — every roadmap item appears
here (shipped ones struck through with a date). When you add, ship, or reword a
roadmap item, update BOTH files so they never drift.** Effort: **S** ≈ a
session, **M** ≈ a day or two, **L** ≈ a week-plus.

### Security hardening

| Feature | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Native TLS listener (`JANUS_TLS_CERT/KEY`, optional ACME)~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — native HTTPS: static certs (`JANUS_TLS_CERT`/`JANUS_TLS_KEY`) or ACME/Let's Encrypt (`JANUS_TLS_ACME_DOMAINS`/`_EMAIL`/`_CACHE`, via `x/crypto/acme/autocert`), mutually exclusive + startup-validated, TLS 1.2 floor, optional `JANUS_TLS_REDIRECT_HTTP` HTTP→HTTPS 301; aux listeners drain on shutdown. No migration. See [production-deployment guide](docs/guides/production-deployment.md). | ~~M~~ |
| ~~TOTP second factor for password logins (+ recovery codes)~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-21** — RFC 6238 TOTP + single-use recovery codes; self-service enroll/confirm/disable/regenerate (`/v1/auth/totp/*`), login gains `totp_code` (`401 totp_required` without it), `janus login` prompts + retries, Settings enroll UI. Secret master-key-wrapped (re-wrapped by master-key rotation), recovery codes HMAC-hashed + single-use, value-free audit. Migration 000025. **Note:** OIDC login is not gated by app-level TOTP (the IdP owns MFA) — see follow-ups. Passkeys/WebAuthn + per-account lockout as follow-ups. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Session management — list active sessions, revoke one/all~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-20** — `GET/DELETE /v1/auth/sessions` (self-service, IP/user-agent metadata, current-session marker), Settings → Active sessions UI, `janus session list/revoke`. Sessions now record client IP + user-agent (migration 000023). | An admin who suspects a stolen cookie has nothing to pull today. | ~~S~~ |
| ~~Account lockout / progressive backoff~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-22** — see the "Open — backend / ops" entry above (migration 000026, `JANUS_LOCKOUT_*`, admin unlock). | Nothing locked an account out after repeated failed logins. | ~~S~~ |
| ~~Secret expiry / max-age policy per key or config, surfaced in-app~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — **advisory** max-age (never blocks reads/writes): config-level default + per-key override, effective policy = per-key else config-default else none, `stale` computed from the current value version's age. `config_secret_max_age` table (migration 000028, config-default under the `''` sentinel key), `GET/PUT /v1/configs/{cid}/max-age` + `PUT .../secrets/{key}/max-age`, `secret:write` to set / `secret:read` to list, value-free audit; masked-list gains `stale`+`max_age_seconds`; editor stale chip + set/clear controls + Overview in-tray count; `janus secrets max-age` CLI. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Break-glass access — time-boxed role elevation with a mandatory reason, stamped into the audit chain~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — guarded self-service emergency elevation: activate only on a scope where you already hold a role, to a strictly-higher role (≤ owner), mandatory reason, TTL clamped to `JANUS_BREAKGLASS_MAX_TTL` (default 1h). Authz effective role = max(bound, active non-expired grant on the exact scope, re-checked against the engine clock). Loud `breakglass.activate/revoke/expire` audit (fail-closed) wired into notifications (`breakglass.activated`); self-revoke + boot-time expiry sweep; activate UI + active-grants list + Overview banner. Migration 000031. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Per-token IP allowlists + usage anomaly notes (new IP)~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — optional per-token CIDR allowlist enforced in the API auth middleware (service-token auth only; out-of-list → 403; IPv4+IPv6; fails closed on an unparseable IP; client IP from `r.RemoteAddr` like the audit log, XFF untrusted). Value-free new-IP detection via `token_seen_ips` (best-effort `INSERT ON CONFLICT`, `token.new_ip` audit + Overview in-tray). Migration 000032. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~GCP KMS / Azure Key Vault auto-unseal~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — both providers on the provider-agnostic `KMSUnsealer` (parameterized with its seal type; AWS unchanged). `JANUS_SEAL_TYPE=gcpkms` (`JANUS_GCP_KMS_KEY`, ambient ADC) / `azurekv` (`JANUS_AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL`+`_KEY_NAME`[+`_KEY_VERSION`], ambient `DefaultAzureCredential`). New seal-type constants, no migration; `internal/crypto` held at 100% coverage with faked KMS APIs. | ~~M~~ |

### Secret lifecycle & editor

| Feature | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Dotenv / properties import in the editor~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-19** — Import… paste or pick a `.env`/`.properties` file, preview per-key (new/overwrite/invalid), stage into the dirty buffer, commit as one version. | The first thing a migrating user does is re-key an existing `.env` by hand. | ~~S~~ |
| ~~Value generator in the editor (random password / hex / base64, length picker)~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-22** — client-side CSPRNG (unbiased rejection sampling), "Gen" popover on the editable value cell: password (symbols / exclude-ambiguous toggles) / hex / base64 + length; value flows through the normal dirty-buffer save, no endpoint/migration. | ~~S~~ |
| ~~Unused-secret detection — "not read in 90 days" chip from audit data~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — **advisory** (blocks nothing): per-key last-read = `MAX(occurred_at)` over `secret.reveal` audit events; masked list gains `last_read_at`+`unused`; editor "not read 90d+ / never read" chip + Overview in-tray count; threshold `JANUS_UNUSED_SECRET_DAYS` (default 90); migration 000029 (partial index on reveal events). Value-free. Bulk raw reads aren't per-key attributable (documented); inherited keys read as never-read on the leaf. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Per-key read insights — last-read + 30-day sparkline in the editor row~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — value-free `GET /v1/configs/{cid}/read-insights` (per key: `last_read_at` + 30-int `daily` reveal counts) from `secret.reveal` audit events, reusing the 000029 partial index (no migration); editor row Reads panel with the `Sparkline` component. Rides `secret:read`, unaudited like the masked list. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Cross-environment diff view — pick any two configs, key-level presence/drift (values masked)~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — `GET /v1/configs/{cid}/compare?against={cid}` returns **booleans only** (in_a/in_b/differs + per-side origin), never a value; requires `secret:read` on BOTH configs (each authorized independently, denial audited) + one value-free `config.compare` audit event; generalizes the promotion preview. New Compare screen + nav + palette entry. No migration. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Secret annotations — owner + note metadata per key (never values)~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — `config_secret_annotations` (migration 000033, value-free); `PUT /v1/configs/{cid}/secrets/{key}/annotation`, `owner`/`note` on the masked list, editor affordance; `secret:write` to set / `secret:read` to view; value-free audit. Mirrors the max-age pattern. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Require-approval-for-prod-edits toggle — direct saves to protected configs become a promotion-style request~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-24** — per-config `require_approval` flag (`promotion:manage` to toggle); a save to a protected config files a **pending edit request** (`202`, not a commit) with the proposed changes **envelope-encrypted** (fresh DEK under the project KEK, domain-separated `ConfigEditRequestAAD`); a **different** user with `secret:write` approves (four-eyes, self-approval `403`, mark-on-success CAS → commit via `SetSecrets`) or rejects; requester cancels. Migration 000036. Value-free (key names only); crypto 100%. Editor Protect toggle + Approvals section. | ~~M~~ |

### Integrations & delivery

| Feature | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| ~~More sync providers: GitLab CI, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel/Netlify env, AWS SSM/Secrets Manager~~ **ALL SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — the sync engine now has **8 providers**: `github`, `k8s`, `gitlab`, `aws_ssm`, `cloudflare`, `aws_secrets`, and **`vercel` + `netlify`** (both net/http, upsert+prune, `api_token` cred; #130 also restored Cloudflare's REST decode fields). No migration. (GitLab CI/CD variables, GitHub Actions, K8s Secrets, Cloudflare Workers secrets, Vercel/Netlify env vars, AWS SSM Parameter Store + Secrets Manager.) | ~~M each~~ |
| ~~More CI federation issuers: GitLab, Buildkite, CircleCI OIDC~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — provider-aware required-claim rule (replaces the hardcoded GitHub `repository` requirement: GitHub→`repository`, GitLab→`project_path`, Buildkite→`organization_slug`, CircleCI→org/project claim; unknown issuer → any non-empty claim), issuer presets + URL validation, single-active-issuer model, `web/src/lib/federation.ts` preset dropdown. No migration. | ~~S each~~ |
| ~~Inbound one-shot importers: Doppler, Vault KV, AWS SM → project/config tree~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-24** — CLI-first `janus import doppler|vault|aws-sm`: fetches from the source (creds from flags/env, never stored), maps → a Janus project/env/config (create-if-missing), writes as one batched config version via the existing authed client. **Default `--dry-run`** prints key names + counts only (never values); `--confirm` writes. Doppler/Vault via net/http, AWS-SM via the existing aws-sdk. No new server endpoint/migration/dep. Web wizard remains a possible follow-up. | ~~L~~ |
| ~~Notifications: webhook + Slack for rotation failures, sync errors, denials, pending approvals~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-21** — audit-tailing dispatcher + delivery outbox; webhook + Slack channels; `notification:manage`, `/v1/notifications/channels`, `janus notifications` CLI, Notifications web screen; migration 000024. **SMTP email channel added 2026-07-23** (`type=smtp`, `net/smtp` STARTTLS/implicit/none, verify-by-default + per-channel `insecure_skip_verify`, write-only password, value-free body; migration 000027). | Failures must find humans, not just an in-app tray. | ~~M~~ |
| Terraform provider (projects, configs, secrets-as-writes, tokens, bindings) | Infra teams won't click UIs; declarative config is table stakes. | L |
| Client SDKs (Go, TypeScript, Python) with in-process caching + lease renewal | `janus run` covers processes; apps wanting native reads shouldn't hand-roll HTTP. | L |
| More rotators: ~~MySQL~~, ~~Redis ACL~~, AWS IAM access keys, generic OAuth client-credential refresh | Same crash-safe framework, new drivers. **`mysql` + `redis` SHIPPED 2026-07-24** — MySQL `ALTER USER … IDENTIFIED BY ?` (bound-param password, never interpolated; strict identifier validation; `go-sql-driver/mysql`) + Redis `ACL SETUSER` via hand-rolled RESP (no dep; rule-token validation blocks credential smuggling). Sanitized errors, no migration. **AWS IAM keys / OAuth refresh remain.** | M each |

### Operations & observability

| Feature | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Prometheus `/metrics` + health panel~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-22** — see the "Open — backend / ops" entry above (`JANUS_METRICS_TOKEN`, `GET /v1/sys/status`, Settings → Health). | Self-hosting is a black box until it breaks. | ~~S~~ |
| ~~Scheduled encrypted backups to S3-compatible storage with retention + a restore-rehearsal command~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — `internal/backupsched` on `JANUS_BACKUP_TICK`: produces the sealed backup artifact, `PutObject`s to S3-compatible storage (custom endpoint for MinIO/R2/B2, static creds only), retention prune (keep N), `backup_runs` history (migration 000035). `janus backup rehearse` / `POST /v1/sys/backup/rehearse` verifies a backup restores WITHOUT clobbering live data. Sealed-artifact property preserved; value-free. `GET /v1/sys/status` gains a `backup` block. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Audit shipping — stream JSONL to webhook/syslog/S3 for SIEM ingestion, with a high-water mark~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** (webhook + syslog; S3 covered by scheduled backups) — `internal/auditship` tails the audit log past a durable high-water mark (migration 000034), ships JSONL to a webhook (optional HMAC-SHA256 sig) or RFC 5424 syslog (UDP/TCP), advances the mark only on success (at-least-once, no gaps). `JANUS_AUDIT_SHIP_*` env; `GET /v1/sys/status` gains an `audit_ship` block. Value-free. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~Health panel in Settings — DB latency, scheduler tick ages, failed-run counts~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-22** (with Prometheus metrics — `GET /v1/sys/status` + Settings → Health). | ~~S~~ |
| ~~First-run onboarding checklist (create project → add secrets → mint token → `janus run`)~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — dashboard checklist on the Overview; steps auto-check from existing state (projects / any secret via 403-tolerant masked-list probe / `listTokens`), step 4 shows a copyable `janus login`→`setup`→`run` block; hides once set up, dismissible (localStorage). Frontend-only, no migration/endpoint. | ~~S~~ |

### UI polish

| Feature | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Global key search in the command palette (search masked key names across configs)~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-22** — `GET /v1/search/keys` (names-only, deny-by-default per-config `SecretRead` filter, no audit/no value, bounded) + palette "Secret keys" group with `?key=` editor deep-link. Adversarial review SHIP. | ~~S~~ |
| ~~Bulk row selection in the editor — multi-select → delete / promote / export~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — per-row checkboxes + select-all (filter-aware), bulk-action bar: Delete selected (stages into the dirty buffer), Reveal selected (audited per-key), Export selected (confirm-gated `.env` of the selection). Frontend-only, reuses existing audited-reveal/download flows. | ~~M~~ |
| ~~JSON/PEM awareness for file-type secrets — pretty-print, validate, syntax hint~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — client-side format sniff (content first, declared `type` as fallback) on the value being edited: JSON/PEM badge, well-formedness check (JSON parse error, PEM label/base64 faults) surfaced inline, one-click Pretty-print for valid JSON. Advisory only — never blocks a save; nothing leaves the browser. | ~~S~~ |
| ~~Shortcuts help modal (`?`) + `g`-prefixed nav chords~~ **SHIPPED 2026-07-23** — `?` opens a shortcuts modal (palette action too); `g` + letter jumps to any screen (`g p` Projects, `g a` Audit, …). Chords are suppressed while typing, with modifiers, or while a dialog is open; a pending-chord hint shows after `g`. | ~~S~~ |
| Accessibility pass — focus traps in modals, ARIA on tables, reduced-motion audit | A deliberate pass would close the remaining gaps. | M |
| Mobile/tablet layout for read-mostly screens (dashboard, audit, approvals) | Approving a promotion from a phone is a real workflow. | M |

### Suggested near-term slate

Almost the entire roadmap is shipped. The 2026-07-24 batch landed
**require-approval-for-prod-edits, MySQL + Redis rotators, and inbound importers
(Doppler / Vault / AWS SM)**. What remains, weighing leverage against effort:

1. **More rotators (round 2)** (3.x) — AWS IAM access keys + generic OAuth
   client-credential refresh on the same crash-safe framework.
2. **More CI federation issuers / sync providers (round 2)** — the trust/adapter
   models are proven; add-on-demand (e.g. more OIDC issuers, more sync targets).
3. **Terraform provider** (L) — projects/configs/secrets-as-writes/tokens/bindings;
   infra teams want declarative config.
4. **Client SDKs** (L) — Go / TS / Python with in-process caching + lease renewal.
5. **Accessibility pass** (5.5) + **Mobile/tablet layout** (5.6) — the remaining
   UI-quality polish. (An **import web wizard** on top of the shipped CLI is a
   smaller optional follow-up.)
5. **The adoption bets (L)** — inbound importers (Doppler / Vault / AWS SM),
   Terraform provider, client SDKs (Go / TS / Python).

Both parked decisions are **resolved**. Still outstanding among the small
backend/ops items: DB pool tuning, docker-compose resource limits, and
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (folded into the ops-hardening bundle above).
